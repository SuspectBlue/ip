1.  Download the latest release from [source](https://github.com/SuspectBlue/ip).
2.  Run the application from your terminal.
3.  Enter commands like: `todo <description>`, `deadline <description> /by <date/time>`, `event <description> /from <start_time> /to <end_time>`, `list`, `mark <index>`, `unmark <index>` and `delete <index>` to manage your tasks.
